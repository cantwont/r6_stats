## Getting Started

R6_Stats is a simple Python package aimed to get player stats for any platform in just a simple function. This project is still a work-in-progress (WiP) so expect bugs. Please open an issue so I can fix any errors!

## Prerequisites

```bash
pip install requests
pip install beautifulsoup4
pip install lxml
```

## Installation

This will be shortened in the future as I still have some debugging to do

```bash
pip install -i https://test.pypi.org/simple/ r6-stats
```
## Usage
```py
from r6_stats import *

platform = 'pc'
username = 'Spoit.M80'

print(get_profile_views(platform, username))
# 2833937


print(get_profile_level(platform, username))
# 522


print(get_season_info(platform, username))
# {'Heavy Mettle': {'MMR': '2,131', 'Matches': 'Matches 28', 'KD': 'K/D 0.80'}}
# (Spoit's season info was too long so I used mine ðŸ˜‚)


print(get_rank_image('CHAMPION'))
